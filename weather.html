  <u><p>KISUMU AREAS WHERE FLOODING OCCURS.</p></u>
  <p>The recent heavy rainfall in Kenya's Kisumu and Homa Bay counties has caused extensive damage, turning vibrant communities into submerged landscapes of despair. As the waters of River Nyando and Sango overflow, families are locked in a desperate battle against the relentless force of nature.
    The residents along the banks of River Nyando in Kisumu County have been severely affected by the floods. Rising waters have forced families to evacuate their homes, seeking refuge in safer locations as their houses succumb to the deluge.
    Once-fertile farmlands now lie underwater, jeopardizing the livelihoods of local farmers. The floods have also resulted in the loss of livestock, compounding the challenges faced by these communities.
    In neighboring Homabay County, the residents of Kobala, North Karachuonyo are in turmoil as the floods show no mercy.
    Families are being compelled to leave their homes, seeking solace from the persistent floodwaters that encroach upon their once peaceful abodes. The floods have not only submerged their houses but have also devastated their livelihoods, with fields and pastures disappearing beneath the water. The rising tides have also caused homes to collapse, leaving many inhabitants without shelter and exacerbating an already dire situation.
    In Nyakach sub-county, the residents of Sango find themselves trapped in the clutches of the merciless floods. Their once vibrant community has been transformed into a desolate landscape, with homes and farmlands vanishing beneath the rising waters. The floods have not only destroyed their homes and crops but have also claimed the lives of their livestock, further intensifying the challenges faced by the residents. Many are now homeless.
    As the water levels continue to rise and the situation for these communities worsens, the need for immediate help and intervention becomes increasingly urgent. People in these hard-hit areas are bearing the brunt of nature's impact, struggling to cope with the devastating effects of the floods on their lives and livelihoods.
    Rebuilding their lives will be a difficult and daunting task. The continuous heavy rainfall has not only wreaked havoc on the land but has also caused significant damage to the people, who are urgently appealing to the government for assistance during this challenging time.</p>

  <u><p>HOMABAY AREAS WHERE FLOODS MOSTLY OCCURS.</p></u>
  <p>What the senior citizen is experiencing reflects what is happening in other counties across the nation, where floods have caught many by surprise. In Nairobi County, for example, deadly floods have wreaked havoc in residential areas, especially in informal settlements, leaving scores dead.
    Floods have become the most devastating climate change risk, and some areas of the capital city covered with water have never experienced flooding. Environmental experts attribute this to climate change, warning that more damages are likely to be witnessed in the coming years if no intervention is implemented to mitigate the effects of climate change.
    Mr Clifford Omondi, a climatologist and a member of the Environment Institute of Kenya, says the country largely reacts during floods rather than being proactive before disaster strikes.
    “There is inadequate preparedness before, during and after floods. What we are experiencing now clearly shows that there was no preparedness to deal with floods,” he says.
    Floods disrupt service provision when roads, electricity poles and social buildings are damaged. They also lead to loss of lives.
    Mr Omondi expresses concern that most devolved units only spend funds during the flood recovery phase after damages.
    He says devolved governments have not formulated and enacted climate-sensitive policies. “County governments do not have proper legislation, frameworks and development plans that reference resilience to protect infrastructure against unforeseen climate risks,” Mr Omondi says.
    According to the climate expert, some counties have legislations and policies on climate change, but they do put them to use.
    He says all devolved units should have the Town and Building Climatology concept, which deals with the reciprocal influences of buildings and settlements on the one hand and regional climatic conditions on the other.
    “There are signs that more floods will be witnessed in the future,” he says, calling on county governments to plan appropriately for any eventuality, including drought.“Failure to take action now will lead to a fall in the economy and increased poverty. The government should not wait for people to be displaced or die before responding; rather, there should be a preparedness plan to reduce damages caused by floods,” he says.
    According to the Climate Economy Report, it is estimated that global investment in infrastructure will increase annually due to floods. Mr Omondi says vulnerability to floods should be a course of concern to the whole country.
    “Floods lead to many socio-economic losses and the spread of diseases, which affect communities and families.”
    The expert calls for proper infrastructure planning, saying floods in the country are bound to continue.
    Some infrastructure development policies include land use planning and building codes and standards. However, Mr Omondi says they do not provide adequate requirements for enhancing climate-resilient infrastructure, which he describes as a new concept.
    “Climate variability impacts building planning, design, construction and maintenance. The government must not wait for people to be displaced or die before it reacts,” he says.
    Families in Rachuonyo North, which has been hit hard by floods over the past years, may finally get to live in their homes all year round if the government’s plans are implemented. Water and Sanitation Cabinet Secretary Zachariah Njeru said the government has two projects that it will undertake in the region to address floods. First, the government will construct dykes along River Miriu, which is the main contributor to floods in Rachuonyo North.
    “We are looking for a long-term solution. We have made all plans for the construction of dykes, and the project will begin in two weeks’ time,” Mr Njeru said. A National Youth Service team will desilt the river to control water movement into Lake Victoria.
    “We will similarly construct dykes in lower Tana and Budalangi where floods are a major problem,” Mr Njeru said.
    Later, the government will construct a multi-purpose dam across River Miriu to control water movement within Wang’ Chieng’, which is located at the lower side of the river.
    A location near Sondu has been selected for the construction of Magwagwa dam. When it rains upstream, River Miriu typically holds large volumes of water. Some is deposited on farmland as water moves downstream near Miriu market at the border between Nyakach and Karachuonyo. Most of the water ends up in homes. The situation has been recurring year in, year out, leaving families in poverty as most of them cannot invest for fear of incurring losses. Others have to spend a lot of money to repair their houses each time they are destroyed by floods.
    Mr Njeru said the dykes will be constructed on both sides of River Miriu.“Other rivers that are prone to floods will also have dykes constructed along them,” the CS said when he visited flood victims who had converged at Rakwaro chief’s camp to get relief food.</p>

  <u><p>NATURAL DISASTER IN BUSIA COUNTY AREAS OF BUDALANGI.</p></u>
  <p>Natural disasters continue to cause deaths, injuries, and economic loses around the world. One such disaster is floods. Flooding in Kenya is experienced perennially and most affected areas are Budalang’i, Nyatike, Kano plains and Lower parts of Tana River. Budalang’i flood plain has experienced floods since 1937 up to 2013.These floods have had effects on the livelihoods of the people in Budalang’i flood plain hence the residents have learnt to survive with the effects by employing several coping strategies. These coping strategies have developed into alternative livelihoods over the years, however, they seem to be unsustainable since there are high rates of absolute poverty and people are always in need of help during floods. This study therefore sought to examine why the livelihoods of households in Budalang’i flood plain remained unsustainable over the years. Specifically, the study sought to address three research objectives: first was to find out the livelihood diversification strategies adopted by households due to the perennial floods; second was to establish the determinants of livelihood diversification strategies employed by the households in Budalang’i and finally to examine the factors influencing the sustainability of the households’ livelihood diversification strategies adopted. The study population comprised of households that were mostly affected by the occurrence of floods and this were mainly in Bunyala Central but some were also in parts of Bunyala West. The study used two methods of data collection which included household survey and key informant interviews. A sample of sixty households were selected for the household survey while eight key informants who included two chiefs of the two locations, four villages elders, an official from government and non-governmental organization in the area. The study findings revealed that the respondents still regard crop farming as their major source of livelihoods despite the perennial floods. The respondents are also involved in fishing, small scale business, casual work on the farms and some are employed in low paying jobs. Livelihood diversification of the household was determined by several factors.</p>

<u><p>SITUATION OVERVIEW & HUMANITARIAN IMPACTS</p></u>
<p>Heavy rains and floods continue to wreak havoc across Kenya, resulting in loss of lives, property, and service disruption. Transport, housing, education, health, and agriculture are the most affected sectors by the floods, according to the authorities. An estimated 267 people have been killed, 188 injured, 75 missing, while 281,835 people (56,367 families) have been displaced and 380,573 (76,114 families) affected by persistent heavy rains and flooding as of 9 May, according to the National Disaster Operations Centre (NDOC). At least 9,973 livestock have been lost, 41,562 acres of croplands and 61 roads damaged, 886 businesses, 1,967 schools and 62 health facilities affected as of 9 May, according to the authorities and the KRCS. On 4 May, Tropical Cyclone Hidaya made its landfall in the Coastal regions accompanied by heavy rains and strong winds, thereby worsening the damage already caused by deadly floods in the country. Beach activities, including fishing, swimming, and non-essential movement along the Coastal region shoreline in Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi and Lamu counties were suspended until 6 May. Fishing at Turkwel Dam in Turkana County remains suspended through a notice issued by the Kerio Valley Development Authority (KVDA) as of 10 May. On 5 May, the Nyando River burst its bank submerging the entire Ahero township and disrupting movement on the Kisumu-Nairobi highway. Air and boat rescue operations were conducted, rescuing 22 people, and evacuating marooned residents from the affected areas. On 6 May, West Pokot, Nakuru, Kiambu, Nyeri, Machakos, Mandera, Embu, Meru, Laikipia, Isiolo, Bomet and Uasin Gishu counties also experienced heavy rains and flooding. In Kajiado County, the Entasopia Healthcare centre, a level 3 healthcare facility serving nearly 3,000 people from surrounding remote areas was damaged by flash floods.</p>
