    <h3>About Diani.</h3>
    <p> Diani Beach is a major beach resort on the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya . It is located 30 kilometers south of Mombasa, in the nearby Kwale County and also known to be a popular kite surfing location.
      Diani Beach is about 10 kilometers long, from the Kongo River to the north and Galu Beach. It is adjacent to the town of Ukunda, the population of which nears 100,000 inhabitants.
      Diani Airstrip is located close to the beach and places to stay.
      The sea remains shallow near shore, with some underwater sandbars near the surface which allow wading with a clear view of the sandy bottom.
      The general area is known for its coral reefs, black-and-white colobus monkeys, and for the closely located Shimba Hills National Reserve a wildlife reserve which looks out over the Indian Ocean. Diani Beach has high-class restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, and several shopping centers.</p>

    <h4>NATURE AND WILDLIFE TOURS IN DIANI BEACH.</h4>
    <p>We do also have animals around diani that makes tourists love our country.The animals in the areas are cool animals.They love seeing people around the place.Animals and plants have always had an impact on things like food, religion, and beliefs. Regional cuisine, "like in Maasai, nyama choma," is prepared with local and uncommon ingredients in many indigenous communities to maintain memory and custom.Managing wildlife resources is largely a problem in land and water use. What can be done at present often is indicated by past events, insofar as these can be interpreted reliably. The coming of Caucasian man to North America vastly altered the complex of pristine plant-animal communities. It appears reasonable to assume that most such communities represented a stage in a developmental series of types trending toward stability. The progression of changes was monitored by climate, conditioned by the substrate, and often modified or suspended by the influences of animals or aboriginal man. Although the dynamics of natural ecosystems are too little understood, biological investigations since 1920 have revealed relationships sufficiently consistent for guidance in many aspects of resource use.</p>
